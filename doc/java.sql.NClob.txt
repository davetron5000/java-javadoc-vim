*java.sql.NClob_Description*

The mapping in the JavaTM programming language for the SQL NCLOB type. An SQL NCLOB is a built-in type that stores a Character 
Large Object using the National Character Set as a column value in a row of a database table. The NClob interface extends the 
Clob interface which provides provides methods for getting the length of an SQL NCLOB value, for materializing a NCLOB value on 
the client, and for searching for a substring or NCLOB object within a NCLOB value. A NClob object, just like a Clob object, is 
valid for the duration of the transaction in which it was created. Methods in the interfaces (|java.sql.ResultSet|) , 
(|java.sql.CallableStatement|) , and (|java.sql.PreparedStatement|) , such as getNClob and setNClob allow a programmer to 
access an SQL NCLOB value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating a NCLOB value. 

All methods on the NClob interface must be fully implemented if the JDBC driver supports the data type.
