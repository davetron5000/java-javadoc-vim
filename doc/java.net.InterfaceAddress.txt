*java.net.InterfaceAddress_Methods*
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.equals(Object)|Compares this object against the specified object.
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.getAddress()|Returns an InetAddress for this address.
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.getBroadcast()|Returns an InetAddress for the brodcast address  for this InterfaceAddress.
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.getNetworkPrefixLength()|Returns the network prefix length for this address.
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.hashCode()|Returns a hashcode for this Interface address.
|java.net.InterfaceAddress.toString()|Converts this Interface address to a String.

*java.net.InterfaceAddress_Description*

This class represents a Network Interface address. In short it's an IP address, a subnet mask and a broadcast address when the 
address is an IPv4 one. An IP address and a network prefix length in the case of IPv6 address. 



*java.net.InterfaceAddress.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compares this object against the specified object. The result is true if and only if the argument is not null and it represents 
the same interface address as this object. 

Two instances of InterfaceAddress represent the same address if the InetAddress, the prefix length and the broadcast are the 
same for both. 


    obj - the object to compare against. 

    Returns: true if the objects are the same; false otherwise. 

*java.net.InterfaceAddress.getAddress()*

public |java.net.InetAddress| getAddress()

Returns an InetAddress for this address. 



    Returns: the InetAddress for this address. 

*java.net.InterfaceAddress.getBroadcast()*

public |java.net.InetAddress| getBroadcast()

Returns an InetAddress for the brodcast address for this InterfaceAddress. 

Only IPv4 networks have broadcast address therefore, in the case of an IPv6 network, null will be returned. 



    Returns: the InetAddress representing the broadcast address or null if there is no broadcast address. 

*java.net.InterfaceAddress.getNetworkPrefixLength()*

public short getNetworkPrefixLength()

Returns the network prefix length for this address. This is also known as the subnet mask in the context of IPv4 addresses. 
Typical IPv4 values would be 8 (255.0.0.0), 16 (255.255.0.0) or 24 (255.255.255.0). Typical IPv6 values would be 128 (::1/128) 
or 10 (fe80::203:baff:fe27:1243/10) 



    Returns: a short representing the prefix length for the subnet of that address. 

*java.net.InterfaceAddress.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns a hashcode for this Interface address. 



    Returns: a hash code value for this Interface address. 

*java.net.InterfaceAddress.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Converts this Interface address to a String. The string returned is of the form: InetAddress / prefix length [ broadcast 
address ]. 



    Returns: a string representation of this Interface address.
