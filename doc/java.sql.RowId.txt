*java.sql.RowId_Description*

The representation (mapping) in the Java programming language of an SQL ROWID value. An SQL ROWID is a built-in type, a value 
of which can be thought of as an address for its identified row in a database table. Whether that address is logical or, in any 
respects, physical is determined by its originating data source. 

Methods in the interfaces ResultSet, CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as getRowId and setRowId allow a programmer 
to access a SQL ROWID value. The RowId interface provides a method for representing the value of the ROWID as a byte array or 
as a String. 

The method getRowIdLifetime in the interface DatabaseMetaData, can be used to determine if a RowId object remains valid for the 
duration of the transaction in which the RowId was created, the duration of the session in which the RowId was created, or, 
effectively, for as long as its identified row is not deleted. In addition to specifying the duration of its valid lifetime 
outside its originating data source, getRowIdLifetime specifies the duration of a ROWID value's valid lifetime within its 
originating data source. In this, it differs from a large object, because there is no limit on the valid lifetime of a large 
object within its originating data source. 

All methods on the RowId interface must be fully implemented if the JDBC driver supports the data type. 



*java.sql.RowId.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compares this RowId to the specified object. The result is true if and only if the argument is not null and is a RowId object 
that represents the same ROWID as this object. 

It is important to consider both the origin and the valid lifetime of a RowId when comparing it to another RowId. If both are 
valid, and both are from the same table on the same data source, then if they are equal they identify the same row; if one or 
more is no longer guaranteed to be valid, or if they originate from different data sources, or different tables on the same 
data source, they may be equal but still not identify the same row. 


    obj - the Object to compare this RowId object against. 

    Returns: true if the RowIds are equal; false otherwise 

*java.sql.RowId.getBytes()*

public byte[] getBytes()

Returns an array of bytes representing the value of the SQL ROWID designated by this java.sql.RowId object. 



    Returns: an array of bytes, whose length is determined by the driver supplying the connection, representing the value of the ROWID 
             designated by this java.sql.RowId object. 

*java.sql.RowId.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code value of this RowId object. 



    Returns: a hash code for the RowId 

*java.sql.RowId.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a String representing the value of the SQL ROWID designated by this java.sql.RowId object. 

Like java.sql.Date.toString() returns the contents of its DATE as the String "2004-03-17" rather than as DATE literal in SQL 
(which would have been the String DATE "2004-03-17"), toString() returns the contents of its ROWID in a form specific to the 
driver supplying the connection, and possibly not as a ROWID literal. 



    Returns: a String whose format is determined by the driver supplying the connection, representing the value of the ROWID designated by 
             this java.sql.RowId object.
