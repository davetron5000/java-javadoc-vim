*java.awt.event.MouseAdapter_Description*

An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events. The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as convenience for 
creating listener objects. 

Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked, moved, dragged, when it enters a component, when it 
exits and when a mouse wheel is moved. 

Extend this class to create aMouseEvent(including drag and motion events) or/andMouseWheelEventlistener and override the 
methods for the events of interest. (If you implement theMouseListener,MouseMotionListenerinterface, you have to define all of 
the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you 
care about.) 

Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a component using the 
component'saddMouseListeneraddMouseMotionListener,addMouseWheelListenermethods. The relevant method in the listener object is 
invoked and theMouseEventorMouseWheelEventis passed to it in following cases: 

when a mouse button is pressed, released, or clicked (pressed and released) when the mouse cursor enters or exits the component 
when the mouse wheel rotated, or mouse moved or dragged
