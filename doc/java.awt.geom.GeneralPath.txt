*java.awt.geom.GeneralPath_Description*

TheGeneralPathclass represents a geometric path constructed from straight lines, and quadratic and cubic (Bzier) curves. It can 
contain multiple subpaths. GeneralPathis a legacy final class which exactly implements the behavior of its superclass 
(|java.awt.geom.Path2D.Float|) . Together with (|java.awt.geom.Path2D.Double|) , the (|java.awt.geom.Path2D|) classes provide 
full implementations of a general geometric path that support all of the functionality of the (|java.awt.Shape|) and 
(|java.awt.geom.PathIterator|) interfaces with the ability to explicitly select different levels of internal coordinate 
precision. 

UsePath2D.Float(or this legacyGeneralPathsubclass) when dealing with data that can be represented and used with floating point 
precision. UsePath2D.Doublefor data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision. 



*java.awt.geom.GeneralPath()*

public GeneralPath()

Constructs a new empty single precisionGeneralPathobject with a default winding rule of (|java.awt.geom.GeneralPath|) . 


*java.awt.geom.GeneralPath(int)*

public GeneralPath(int rule)

Constructs a new GeneralPath object with the specified winding rule to control operations that require the interior of the path 
to be defined. 

    rule - the winding rule 

*java.awt.geom.GeneralPath(int,int)*

public GeneralPath(
  int rule,
  int initialCapacity)

Constructs a new GeneralPath object with the specified winding rule and the specified initial capacity to store path 
coordinates. This number is an initial guess as to how many path segments will be added to the path, but the storage is 
expanded as needed to store whatever path segments are added. 

    rule - the winding rule 
    initialCapacity - the estimate for the number of path segments in the path 

*java.awt.geom.GeneralPath(Shape)*

public GeneralPath(java.awt.Shape s)

Constructs a new GeneralPath object from an arbitrary (|java.awt.Shape|) object. All of the initial geometry and the winding 
rule for this path are taken from the specified Shape object. 

    s - the specified Shape object
