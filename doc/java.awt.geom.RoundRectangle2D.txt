*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D_Description*

The RoundRectangle2D class defines a rectangle with rounded corners defined by a location(x,y), a dimension(w x h), and the 
width and height of an arc with which to round the corners. 

This class is the abstract superclass for all objects that store a 2D rounded rectangle. The actual storage representation of 
the coordinates is left to the subclass. 



*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D()*

protected RoundRectangle2D()

This is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly. Type-specific implementation subclasses are available for 
instantiation and provide a number of formats for storing the information necessary to satisfy the various accessor methods 
below. 


*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.contains(double,double)*

public boolean contains(
  double x,
  double y)





*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.contains(double,double,double,double)*

public boolean contains(
  double x,
  double y,
  double w,
  double h)





*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Determines whether or not the specified Object is equal to this RoundRectangle2D. The specified Object is equal to this 
RoundRectangle2D if it is an instance of RoundRectangle2D and if its location, size, and corner arc dimensions are the same as 
this RoundRectangle2D. 


    obj - an Object to be compared with this RoundRectangle2D. 

    Returns: true if obj is an instance of RoundRectangle2D and has the same values; false otherwise. 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.getArcHeight()*

public abstract double getArcHeight()

Gets the height of the arc that rounds off the corners. 



    Returns: the height of the arc that rounds off the corners of this RoundRectangle2D. 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.getArcWidth()*

public abstract double getArcWidth()

Gets the width of the arc that rounds off the corners. 



    Returns: the width of the arc that rounds off the corners of this RoundRectangle2D. 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.getPathIterator(AffineTransform)*

public |java.awt.geom.PathIterator| getPathIterator(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform at)

Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of this RoundRectangle2D. The iterator for this class is multi-threaded 
safe, which means that this RoundRectangle2D class guarantees that modifications to the geometry of this RoundRectangle2D 
object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process. 


    at - an optional AffineTransform to be applied to the coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or null if untransformed 
       coordinates are desired 

    Returns: the PathIterator object that returns the geometry of the outline of this RoundRectangle2D, one segment at a time. 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns the hashcode for this RoundRectangle2D. 



    Returns: the hashcode for this RoundRectangle2D. 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.intersects(double,double,double,double)*

public boolean intersects(
  double x,
  double y,
  double w,
  double h)





*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.setFrame(double,double,double,double)*

public void setFrame(
  double x,
  double y,
  double w,
  double h)





*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.setRoundRect(double,double,double,double,double,double)*

public abstract void setRoundRect(
  double x,
  double y,
  double w,
  double h,
  double arcWidth,
  double arcHeight)

Sets the location, size, and corner radii of this RoundRectangle2D to the specified double values. 


    x - the X coordinate to which to set the location of this RoundRectangle2D 
    y - the Y coordinate to which to set the location of this RoundRectangle2D 
    w - the width to which to set this RoundRectangle2D 
    h - the height to which to set this RoundRectangle2D 
    arcWidth - the width to which to set the arc of this RoundRectangle2D 
    arcHeight - the height to which to set the arc of this RoundRectangle2D 

*java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D.setRoundRect(RoundRectangle2D)*

public void setRoundRect(java.awt.geom.RoundRectangle2D rr)

Sets this RoundRectangle2D to be the same as the specified RoundRectangle2D. 


    rr - the specified RoundRectangle2D
